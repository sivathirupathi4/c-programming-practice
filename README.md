## Day 1: Learned and practiced the basic fundementals of c

This repository contains my daily C programming practice programs.

 Topics Covered:
- C Fundamentals
- Operators
- Control Statements

## Day 2 - Decision Making Statements

Topics Covered:
- Nested if-else
- Switch case statement

Programs:
- Grade calculation using nested if-else
- Menu-driven program using switch

These concepts helped me understand how C programs make decisions based on conditions.

## Day 3 - Loops and Increment/Decrement

Topics Covered:
- For loop
- Pre-increment and post-increment
- Pre-decrement and post-decrement
- Understanding loop execution flow

Programs Implemented:
- Printing numbers using for loop
- Demonstrating difference between ++i and i++
- Demonstrating difference between --i and i--

This helped me understand iteration and value changes during program execution.

## Day 4 - Loop Based Problems

Problems Practiced:
- Perfect Number
- Sum of Factors
- Factorial of a Number
- Power Calculation (Base & Exponent)

These problems helped me strengthen my understanding of loops and mathematical logic implementation in C.

## Day 5 - Basic Real-World Programs

Programs Practiced:
- Average of float numbers
- Simple Interest calculation
- Temperature conversion
- Greeting message based on time

These programs helped me understand real-time problem solving using C with float data types and conditional logic.

## Day 6 - Conditional Logic Programs

Programs Practiced:
- Uppercase, Lowercase, Digit checker
- Theatre ticket price calculation
- Marks to Grade conversion

These programs improved my understanding of conditional statements and character handling in C.

## Day 7 - Switch and Logical Programs

Programs Practiced:
- Middle number among three numbers
- Simple calculator using switch
- Direction selection using switch
- Finding day of the year using switch case

These programs improved my logical comparison skills and understanding of structured decision-making in C.
